## TODO

* Wall
* Fix issue where a single emoji can merge with more than one other emoji at the same time

## Ideas

* Can throw emojis outside arena
* Emojis that are ghosts until they hit one of the same size
* Emojis shoot spikes/objects on merge
* The arena is slightly expandable (side solids are dynamic but connected by joints at the bottom edges)
