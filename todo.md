## Ideas

* Can throw emojis outside arena
* Emojis that are ghosts until they hit one of the same size
* Emojis shoot spikes/objects on merge
* The arena is slightly expandable (side solids are dynamic but connected by joints at the bottom edges)
* Freezes emojis it touches; frozen emojis get broken if an emoji of higher size hits them from above
